# Datastructure 
1. The sorting folder contain following sorting algorithms
  - selection sort
  - bubble sort
  - insertion sort
  - merge sort 
  - quick sort algorithm.
  - It also contains a sortingall.c file in which all the algorithms are implemented at one place and it also give you the option to           generate random numbers and compare the time taken by various algorithms.
2. The  nonlinear.c file contains various operations that can be performed on linklist,queue and stacks.
3. More algorithms coming soon
